Slide 1 – Title
PCD Enhancements, Strategic Solutions & Transformation
Subtitle: Automating Margin Creation & Updates for Efficiency

Slide 2 – Agenda
PCD enhancements and new functionalities

Strategic solutions built on top of PCD

Transforming the existing PCD

Slide 3 – Recap of Previous Solution
Earlier solution: Built on PCD to create & update margins

Today: Quick recap before exploring improvements

Slide 4 – Current Workflow Overview
When Operations receives a market request to revise/create margins:

Request verified by Governance team

Two types of tasks:

Creating margins (Scenario 1)

Updating margins (Scenario 2)

Slide 5 – Scenario 1: Creating Margins (Current Process)
Request via email with currencies, tiers, and segments

Mapping file prepared as base template

Manual entry for each currency pair, row-by-row

Time: ~2 min per currency → ~20 min for 20 pairs + re-checking

Drawbacks: Repetitive, prone to human error, multiple validation layers needed

Slide 6 – Scenario 1: Our Solution – PCD Create Module
Same mapping file → upload to tool instead of manual entry

Automation speed: 20 currencies × 5 combinations in ~20 seconds

With validations, total process: 10–15 min (vs 2 hrs)

Impact: Huge time savings + reduced errors

Slide 7 – Scenario 2: Updating Margins (Current Process)
Triggered for campaigns/offers with discounted margins

Ops team downloads PCD file, compares with request, updates row-by-row

Example: 20% margin decrease → 2 min per combination

Time: > 2 hrs for multiple currency pairs

Drawbacks: Manual, error-prone, slow

Slide 8 – Scenario 2: Our Solution – PCD Update Module
Update methods available:

Replace with new margins

Increase/decrease by %

Increase/decrease by bid points

Process flow: Upload file → choose update method → soft validation summary report

Optional hard validation: OCR to compare request form vs. output before download

Slide 9 – Impact Summary
Before:

Manual process taking ~2 hrs

Multiple checks for error control

High likelihood of mistakes

After PCD Solution:

Task time cut from ~2 hrs to 10–15 min

Automation + validations = reduced errors

Scalable for multiple currencies & combinations instantly

Slide 10 – Closing
PCD enhancements significantly improve speed, accuracy, and scalability

Both creation and update workflows are now leaner & more reliable

Opens scope for further automation and integration

If you want, I can also add visuals/flowcharts for each scenario so it’s not text-heavy.
Do you want me to create a visually designed PPT layout with charts and process diagrams so that it’s ready for presentation? That would make your deck highly engaging for stakeholders.
