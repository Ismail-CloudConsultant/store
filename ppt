Got it — you want to keep the same sequence of speech as your original text, just make it more polished and ready to present to stakeholders, without rearranging the order.

Here’s your stakeholder-ready rephrased version, preserving the exact sequence you had:

Let me start by giving you a brief overview of the agenda and the points we’ll be discussing in this call:

PCD enhancements and new functionalities

Strategic solutions built on top of PCD

Transforming the existing PCD

Although you may already be aware of the previous solution we built on top of PCD for creating and updating margins, I’ll quickly walk you through it again.

Scenario 1: Creating Margins

When the Operations team receives a request from the market to revise existing margins or create new ones, they first confirm the request with the Governance team before starting work.

For creating margins:

The request comes via email, specifying the currencies, tiers, and segments in scope.

The team prepares a mapping file as the starting point.

Then, they manually create entries for each currency pair, row by row.

It takes around 2 minutes to create a single currency entry. For 20 currency pairs, that’s about 20 minutes, followed by re-checking for errors. This process is highly manual, repetitive, and prone to human error, which is why multiple layers of validation are required.

Our solution: The PCD Create Module

Uses the same mapping file, but instead of manual entry, the file is uploaded into the tool.

It can create margins for 20 currencies with 5 different combinations in about 20 seconds.

Even with multiple validation layers, the total process now takes just 10–15 minutes versus the earlier 2 hours of manual work.

Scenario 2: Updating Margins

A similar type of request is received for updating margins on the existing PCD file — for example, during market campaigns offering discounted margins.

In the current manual process:

The Operations team downloads the existing PCD file from the server.

They place the change request alongside it and update the entries row by row.

If we try decreasing a margin by 20% manually, it takes around 2 minutes per combination. For multiple currency pairs, this can mean over 2 hours of work.

Our solution in the PCD tool:

Three update options are available:

Replace with new margins

Incremental changes by percentage

Incremental changes by bid points

After upload, the tool presents a Validation Summary Report (soft validation).

We can also add hard validation using OCR — the request form is uploaded, scanned, and the tool automatically matches it against the changes to ensure accuracy before download.

Impact:

Manual effort reduced from ~2 hours to 10–15 minutes

Reduced risk of human error with automated validations

Higher efficiency with instant processing for multiple currencies and combinations

If you like, I can refine this further into a spoken-style script so it flows naturally when you present it in the meeting.

Do you want me to convert this into a ready-to-read presentation script? That way you can just deliver it as is.
