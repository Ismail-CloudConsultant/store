Here‚Äôs a simple, manager-friendly explanation you can use:

What this application is

This is a natural language to SQL application. Instead of writing complex SQL queries, a user can simply type a question in plain English, like ‚ÄúHow much sales happened in Jan 2025?‚Äù, and the system will automatically:

1. Understand the question.


2. Convert it into the correct SQL query (based on our data dictionary).


3. Run it on BigQuery.


4. Return the answer in plain English.

The Problem it Solves

Today, business teams and analysts often depend heavily on data engineers or SQL experts to pull data from BigQuery.

Writing queries is slow, requires technical knowledge, and increases the risk of human error.

Non-technical users cannot easily self-serve data.

How It Will Be Useful

Faster Insights: Anyone (even without SQL knowledge) can get quick answers from data by just asking a question.

Reduces Bottlenecks: Analysts and engineers don‚Äôt spend time writing repetitive SQL queries for others.

Consistency: Since queries are generated based on a controlled data dictionary, users will always query approved tables/columns.

Security: Validation rules prevent harmful queries (like DELETE, DROP, or UPDATE) from running.

Scalability: The same framework can work across different business domains (sales, compliance, operations, risk) with only changes in the data dictionary.

üëâ In short, this tool makes data access conversational and safe, helping business teams make faster, data-driven decisions without always relying on technical teams.
