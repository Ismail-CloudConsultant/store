Subject: Tool Installation and Usage Guide

Hi Team,
Hope you're doing well.

Thank you so much for your continued support in the development of this tool.
We’ve now built a version that runs locally using Python.

To help you install and run the tool on your system, I’ve recorded a series of detailed videos and organized supporting materials in the following folders:

1. Python Setup – Contains videos and documents for downloading and installing Python.


2. Tool Operations – Part 1


3. Tool Operations – Part 2 – These two folders include videos, documents, and scripts demonstrating various operations within the tool.



Please go through the materials and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
